# JavaScript Snippets

## Kadane's Algorithm

Kadane's algrithm is an algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum of an array.

## Matrix Operations

A selection of operations on arrays of points that represents a shape.

## Random Trig Stuff

I've been having to calculate a bunch of endpoints given some information and degrees so I just threw a few of these together in one place.

## Range Operator

Very often I've wanted to write something like `min <= inputNum <= max` and JavaScript has no nice way to do that (that I know of, please, please correct me). So I created insideRange and outsideRange to temporarily cool the rage I feel every time I have to type out `min <= inputNum && inputNum <= max`.

## Sieve of Eratosthenese/Euler's Sieve

Sieves to find primary numbers by elimination of composite numbers. Eratosthenes' sieve eliminates all multiples of numbers found within the range given to it. Euler's sieve only eliminates those numbers once allowing for some performance gains versus Eratosthenes.
