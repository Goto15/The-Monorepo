## Kadane's Algorithm
Kadane's algrithm is an algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum of an array.

## Sieve of Eratosthenese/Euler's Sieve
Sieves to find primary numbers by elimination of composite numbers. Eratosthenes' sieve eliminates all multiples of numbers found within the range given to it. Euler's sieve only eliminates those numbers once allowing for some performance gains versus Eratosthenes.
